\section{Construction}
\label{sec:Construction}
Construction was very simple with minimal troubleshooting involved despite a misprint. One of the four halves were double but the minor differences in the design of the ridge for holding the lenses was negligible. Paper shims replace the function of the original bolt and set screw fasteners that were planned. The shims also help to align the canisters. The total telescope length (between the two lenses) was \SI{37}{\centi\meter}. while our theoretical sum of focal lengths was \SI{35.5}{\centi\meter}. The inconsistency easily can be traced back to initial focal length measuring experiment and our thin lens approximations. Regardless, this is extremely close to our prediction and falls easily within the \SI{30.5}{\centi\meter} to \SI{43.5}{\centi\meter} range of expansion of our telescope.
