With two lenses, Galileo was able to observe the night sky in more detail than any man before. Although one lens was convex and the other concave, our telescope uses two convex lenses in a similar fashion. This type of telescope is called an astronomical telescope. Its flipped image is inconvenient for viewing objects on earth but less of a bother when viewing astronomical objects. Our 3D printed telescope design features accurate focusing, easy lens insertion, and body rigidity to keep the lenses in line.
