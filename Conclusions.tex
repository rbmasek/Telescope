Overall, the product exceeded our expectations. It functions as it should by producing a clear and magnified image.

The focal length measurements proved to be accurate enough for the purposes of designing and constructing the telescope frame. The exact focal lengths are unneccesary considering the telescope can be set to any length between \SI{30.5}{\centi\meter} and \SI{43.5}{\centi\meter}. 

The planning and designing of the frame took the longest amount of time. In attempt to find the best balance between sturdiness and ease of construction/destruction, it went trhough multiple design changes as we researched more into snap-fit designs and stress/strain minimization. Based on the final product, that time was well spent.

Despite a misprint, the telescope was able to be put together without any issues. The plastic was splitting immediately after being printed, however, this was fixed with paper shims and hot glue. After these quick fixes, the product is now easy to put together as well as take apart without any risk of damaging the product.

The telescope has a magnification of about 3.8x and the product is only about \SI{37}{\centi\meter} long. It is portabale and can be used to make basic observations. Across the entirety of the project, not a single penny was contributed towards the development and production of the telescope.
